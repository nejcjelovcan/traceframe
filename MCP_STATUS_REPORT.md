## MCP Servers Status

### 1. Git MCP Server (`@cyanheads/git-mcp-server`)
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**

Successfully tested tools:
- `git_set_working_dir` - Set repository working directory with metadata
- `git_status` - Check repository status
- `git_log` - View commit history
- `git_branch` - List branches
- `git_diff` - View differences
- `git_add`, `git_commit`, `git_push` - Version control operations
- `git_checkout` - Switch branches
- `git_fetch`, `git_pull` - Sync with remote
- `git_rebase`, `git_merge` - Branch integration

**Functionality:** All git operations are functional. The server correctly identifies the repository, current branch (`tra-109-check-your-mcps`), and provides full git functionality through MCP protocol.

### 2. GitHub MCP Server (`github/github-mcp-server`)
**Status:** ❌ **NOT CONFIGURED**

The GitHub MCP server appears in CLAUDE.md documentation but is not currently configured or available in the environment. No GitHub MCP tools were accessible during testing.

**Expected tools (per documentation):**
- Pull request management
- Code review operations
- Repository operations
- Search functionality

**Action needed:** GitHub MCP server needs to be configured in the MCP settings.

### 3. Linear MCP Server (Linear HTTP MCP)
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**

Successfully tested tools:
- `get_issue` - Retrieve issue details (tested with TRA-109)
- `list_teams` - List Linear teams (found Tapan, Traceframe, Elementex)
- `list_issue_statuses` - Get workflow states (14 states found for Traceframe)
- `list_issues`, `save_issue` - Issue management
- `list_comments`, `create_comment` - Comment operations
- `list_projects`, `get_project` - Project management

**Note:** Some operations like `list_users` require human approval.

**Functionality:** Linear integration is fully operational for issue tracking, project management, and team collaboration.

### 4. mcp-dev Tools (`@nejcjelovcan/mcp-dev`)
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**

Successfully tested tools:
- `list_package_scripts` - List available npm scripts
- `get_changed_packages` - Track modified packages
- `pnpm_query` - Query dependencies
- Build tools: `build_package`, `test_package`, `typecheck_package`
- Code quality: `autofix`, `lint_fix_package`, `format_package`
- Dependency management: `pnpm_add`, `pnpm_remove`, `pnpm_install`
- Testing: `run_single_test`, `test_package_coverage`
- Changeset: `create_changeset`

**Functionality:** Development workflow tools are fully functional, providing comprehensive build, test, and package management capabilities.

### 5. mcp-ui Tools (`@nejcjelovcan/traceframe-mcp-ui`)
**Status:** ✅ **WORKING**

Successfully tested tools:
- `list_components` - List UI library components (6 primitives found)
- `get_component` - Get component details
- `get_design_tokens` - Retrieve design system tokens
- `get_tailwind_utilities` - Get Tailwind utility classes
- `search_icons` - Search icon library (4 results for "search")
- `list_icons`, `get_icon` - Icon management
- `validate_tokens` - Token validation

**Functionality:** UI tooling is fully operational, providing access to components, design tokens, icons, and validation utilities.

## Summary

| MCP Server | Status | Functionality |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Git | ✅ Working | Full git operations |
| GitHub | ❌ Not Configured | Not available |
| Linear | ✅ Working | Issue tracking & project management |
| mcp-dev | ✅ Working | Build, test, lint, package management |
| mcp-ui | ✅ Working | UI components, tokens, icons |

## Key Findings

1. **Git operations**: Fully functional through MCP, eliminating need for CLI git commands
2. **GitHub integration**: Not currently available, needs configuration
3. **Linear integration**: Working well for issue and project management
4. **Development tools**: Comprehensive suite of build and test tools available
5. **UI tooling**: Complete access to design system and components

## Recommendations

1. **Configure GitHub MCP server** to enable PR management and code review features
2. **Use MCP tools exclusively** instead of CLI commands for better integration
3. **Leverage mcp-dev tools** for all build, test, and package management operations
4. **Utilize mcp-ui tools** for component discovery and design token management

## Testing Details

All tests were performed on branch `tra-109-check-your-mcps` with the following environment:
- Working directory: `/app/workspaces/prism/traceframe`
- Repository: `nejcjelovcan/traceframe`
- Date: 2026-02-28
